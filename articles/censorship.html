                        <h1>Introduction</h1>
                        <p>Nowadays, we are accustomed to rampant censorship in our media. From books to TV series, each medium faces it’s share of censorship. As with all new mediums, video games arose as a largely unregulated medium. When video games began to challenge the public’s perception of them as toys in the 1990s, a revolution took hold in video game regulation and censorship. Outrage spilled across the channel; video game companies became revered and condemned, and these stigmas would persist to this very day. This is the story of the origins of video game censorship.</p>

                        <h1>The Industry's Titans</h1>
                        <p>To understand why this revolution took place, you need to understand the video game market in the late 80s and early 90s. There were two major players in the video games’ industry at this time: Sega and Nintendo. Nintendo had held a monopoly on the market for some time, having obsoleted Atari following the market crash in ’83<span class="super">[1]</span>. The Vectrex, Commodore, and Neo Geo were no match for the Nintendo Entertainment System, as is apparent from sales<span class="super">[2]</span>. Finally, Sega launched the Sega Genesis in 1989<span class="super">[3]</span>  and, for the first time Nintendo faced true competition.</p>
                        <p>The Sega Genesis’ advertising railed against Nintendo directly. “Genesis does what Nintendon’t!" <span class="super">[4]</span> was their prime slogan, disseminated through posters, TV shows, and expensive graphic font animations. The so-called “console wars" had begun. It would not be until 1993 that Nintendo’s answer to the Sega Genesis, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System would launch.</p>
                        <p>Sega prided itself on being the “edgy" counterpart to Nintendo. The Sega Genesis’ controller was devoid of the seemingly childish colours used on the SNES’ controller (red, blue, green, yellow). Sega’s mascot, Sonic, was portrayed to be a loudmouth with attitude, quite literally comprised of multiple edges on his back, being a hedgehog. He was a complete foil to Nintendo’s blanketly smiling, round Mario.</p>
                        <p>Sega’s efforts lead to games companies attempting to target their hardware to more mature audiences. This is evidenced from Nintendo’s response to the Sega Genesis controller in North America, redesigning the SNES controller to strip it of its beaming colours, instead replacing them with modest shades of purple<span class="super">[5]</span>. Soon, games would follow this trend, namely… Mortal Kombat.</p>

                        <h1>A Violent Development</h1>
                        <p>Mortal Kombat, upon its release in arcades, had been both revered and feared for its merciless depiction of gore. Mortal Kombat broke many of the conventions of video games to that point. Gamers were accustomed to fantastical lands or cartoonish character designs and art styles, as the scope of art styles a game could achieve were limited by the hardware of the time. Not only was Mortal Kombat filled with gore, its characters and environments were taken from real-life actors<span class="super">[6]</span>. Mortal Kombat crossed the tacit boundaries of what was commonly expected of a video game.</p>

                        <p>The game shook quite a frenzy in the arcades, but it was not until the console ports released that these vivacious depictions of violence had political consequences on an international scale.</p>

                        <h1>Emergence of Controversy</h1>
                        <p>Nintendo was hands on with its games review process. An internal division known as “The Mario Club," outright censored Mortal Kombat before it had the chance to create controversy, replacing the in-game blood with sweat<span class="super">[7]</span>. As Sega was aiming for an edgier demographic, they aimed to satisfy older audiences by allowing the blood to remain, locked behind a cheat code. <span class="super">[7]</span>.</p>
                        <p>In the 1990s, video games were seen as children’s toys, as clearly evidenced from fig. 2. Without formal rating system adults were never considered as an exclusive audience. Sega had their own propriety rating system, on which they ranked their bloodied console version of Mortal Kombat Ma-13<span class="super">[7]</span>, the rough equivalent of PEGI 12. This decision would be regarded as highly objectionable by today’s standards.</p>

                        <p>Sensational media outcry commenced across different TV stations, condemning Mortal Kombat, and questioning the ethics of video game violence. The Peter Jennings report<span class="super">[Fig. 2]</span> asserted that there must be a correlation between virtual violence and real violence, as did many other reports.</p>

As opposed to a system of self-regulation, the Entertainment Software Rating Board was created, finally spawning the process of rating games. <span class=”super”>[8]</span></p>
